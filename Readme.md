utils.py and timegan.py are the support scripts for timegan, which were taken from the following github repository: https://github.com/jsyoon0823/TimeGAN  
several slight changes were made to these files, as they were no longer compatible with current versions of tensorflow. 
For the rest the code should perform the same as the original code.
The pkl file is a saved version of the CTGAN model used for this project. 
The timeGAN model could not be saved, and might therefore perform slightly different when ran again. Synt_timegan_table contains the values used for this project. 
The ttl files are the produced knowledge graphs for both CTGAN and timeGAN.
